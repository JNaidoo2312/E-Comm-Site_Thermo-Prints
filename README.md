# e-commerce
## Goals
1. Responsive on Phone, Tablet, desktop
2. listing of items being sold
3. keep  track of client purchaces
4. keep track client details

##Security
1. enforcing HTTPS
2. There is meant to be an API for posting to db this api would include the item name and count which then queries on the db and stores the item_id + item_count + user_id who ordered item. 
3. This was not included as we never built a user authentication platform and neither can we use a framework for SQL which would help prevent sql injection
